The uniq command in Linux, short for “unique,” is used to isolate unique strings in text documents or standard input. It’s a pretty basic command with a simple purpose, but comes with a few options under the hood that prove themselves handy under a lot of scenarios.


uniq can do things like suppress duplicate lines or count the number of times each word occurs in a piece of text. Linux administrators will find this useful when parsing large log files. For example, rather than seeing the same “error” line repeatedly, a log file can be passed to uniq, which will just tell you how many times the error occurs, giving you a much cleaner, human readable output.

$ uniq distros.txt
$ cat distros.txt | sort | uniq
Use the -c option with uniq if you want to count the number of times each line is repeated.
Use the -d option to only list the lines that have repeats.
By default, uniq is case sensitive, meaning it will not consider “Ubuntu” and “ubuntu” to be repeat lines. This behavior can be changed with the -i option.
$ uniq -i distros.txt
Use the -u option to only output lines that don’t have any repeats.

xargs with examples

Let’s dive right in with a simple xargs example:

$ echo '1' > 1
$ echo '2' > 2
$ echo '3' > 3
$ ls
1  2  3
$ ls | xargs cat
1
2
3

cat test.txt |xargs rm

$ ls | xargs -p rm
rm 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt ?...y

$ ls | xargs -t -n 1 cat
